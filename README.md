Customer Churn prediction model

Objective : An E Commerce company is facing a lot of competition in the current market and it has become a challenge to retain the existing customers in the current situation. Hence, we want to develop a churn prediction model of the accounts and provide segmented offers to the potential churners. 

Feature Importance and insights:                                      
•	Tenure, complain, cashback, Days since CC connect, account segment, CC agent score, account user count are the important features.         
•	More number of people are churning within less tenure.                      
•	Complains are being received within less number of time.                       
•	Super and regular plus customers are more in numbers and also have more churners.                       
•	Customer care agent score has been average and less than that which is 3 and less which clearly depicts the service needs to be improved.    
•	More number of customers tagged to one account are churning more.                        
•	Gender male and singles are more in churning.

Recommendations:     
•	People with less tenure are churning more so the initial service by the company should be good as we can observe that the service and customer care agent scores are less. The customers should be tagged to accounts having tenure 0 and 1 so that the churn rate decreases.   
•	Complains being received should be addressed and proactive call should be taken at the earliest. The Day since CC connect should be more in number which in turn reduces the complains and churn rate will be decreased.                                                  
•	Super and Regular plus account segments have more people and number of churners too are high.
The majority of the churners here use credit and debit card as payment mode. Cashbacks can be given on fixed number of transactions or purchase made so that the churner rate decreases.
•	Account with 4 customers are churning more. This may be due to some technical reasons while all 4 of them are using. So,Customer care agents should contact and try to know the reason by providing them with a short surveys and reverting the same to technical team to resolve. The customers tagged in a account could be reduced to 2 or 3.                                       
•	City tier 1 and 3 has more number of people and churners too at the same point of time.
City tier 2 has least number of people. So, market establishment is required in city tier 2 to keep the business running and there may be other service providers in tier 1 and 3. So we can identify the competitor in that region and improve our services to avoid more people churning.
